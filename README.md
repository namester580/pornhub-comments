# pornhub-comments
a pornhub version for my youtube comment twitter ap that tweets a rando pornhub comment every 30 minutes. 

i currently use nightmare to scrape pornhub because it uses ajax, and because of this running it on heroku might be a pain, but i have found no other solution yet. at the moment it only runs once and then throws some timeout error, it might be because i call a promise in setinterval
